Java XML Signature
==================

This is an example for Java's XML Signature API.
The foundation is a straight copy of [this Oracle tutorial] (http://java.sun.com/developer/technicalArticles/xml/dig_signature_api/).
It reads both private key and public key from PKCS12 to sign or validate XML files.

Usage
----------------
Create `PrivateKeyData` by handing a path and the passphrase for the key file and the private key inside.  
Create either an `XmlSigner` or an `XmlValidator` with it.  
Call `sign` with the path to the unsigned XML file you want to sign and another path indicating where to put the result.  
Call `verify` with the path to the signed XML file you want to verify.

License

Do what you want. Whether it's modify, copy, distribute, use comercially - I don't care.
